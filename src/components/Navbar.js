          Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into
          groups based on common similarities and characteristics. This can
          range from geographic and demographic factors, such as age, location,
          and income, to psychographic and behavioral factors, such as what
          motivates them to shop and how they prefer to shop. Customers are
          categorized using market research, industry and competitor analysis,
          and customer data. When capturing user information, companies should
          focus on zero-party and first-party data, which includes their contact
          information, purchase history, marketing communication preferences,
          and survey responses. Segmentation helps businesses customize their
          marketing strategies to provide shoppers with the brand experiences
          they're looking for. This can range from sending targeted email
          campaigns to designing in-store displays to serving personalized
          digital ads. As a result, customers feel more connected and engaged.
          Personalization can lead to customer loyalty and brand advocacy,
          especially when companies nurture the business-consumer relationship
          in the right ways.
